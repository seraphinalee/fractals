spur 2017


Welcome to the matlab programs we created for use in SPUR 2017. Every mathematical procedure was done in MATLAB.
There are a few python scripts floating around but most of them are for file handling, converting to Tek, etc.

Here is an outline of the file hierarchy - 
1. Everything is self contained within one folder level (output is dumped into 'data'0
2. 'Legacy' is an old outdated copy kept for reference
3. The main diretory contains a working version
4. 'Unstable' is the most up to date but is, of course, also a little more bug prone

'xgen' files make laplacian matrices (ie laplaciangen is for dirichlet). gasketcore and interval core are good places to play around and run scripts
